In this tutorial you will build Orange Tree -- a clone of the popular mobile game [Angry Birds](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ab-classic/id343200656). 
You will use Apple's Swift programming language together with SpriteKit, their game development framework.

# What you will learn

Throughout this tutorial you will learn many concepts including how to:

- Effectively use SpriteKit to rapidly prototype a game
- Build levels using multiple scene files
- Add simple visual effects
- How to work with the built in physics engine

<!-- The above section needs to be expanded. Maybe once the tutorial is finished? It's a bit unclear at this stage. -->

# The finished product
