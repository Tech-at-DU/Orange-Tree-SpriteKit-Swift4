# Summary

Awesome! Now that you have your project set up and your assets in place, you can start 
working on the Angry Birds clone. Before moving on though, build the project to make sure
everything is setup okay so far. Use `CMD+B` to build the project without running it. 
If your project finished building with no errors you are ready to move on to the next section!
