Throughout this tutorial you have created the skeleton of a great game! These challenges are going
to guide you to turning it into a full fledged game and level up your skills in the process!

# Challenge 1 - Implement Game State

In the previous tutorial, Sushi Neko, you learned about creating state for your game to keep track
of when the player is ready, playing, or has gotten a game over. Your challenge is to implement
state for your game in a similar manner. You may need to create a limit to the number of oranges
a user has (aka lives), to complete this.

# Challenge 2 - Adding a Splash Screen and Menu

When you first load up a game, a splash screen is shown while the content is loading. In this 
challenge, your goal is to create a splash screen that showcases your game while it is loading.
The second half of this challenge is to create a menu scene that is loaded up first, before
jumping into any of the levels.

# Challenge 3 - Add More Levels!

This challenge should actually be pretty fun! Create some more levels so that a player has a couple
different levels that they can play :)

# Challenge 4 - GameCenter

This final challenge is going to be a bit tougher than the previous ones. You are going to add
GameCenter integration so that you can keep track of what levels a player has beaten. You want
to track the levels that are completed and show them differently than levels that have yet to
be beaten.

# Summary

If you have completed all of the challenges, congrats! You're all done :)
