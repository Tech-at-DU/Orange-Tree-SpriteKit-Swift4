# Stretch Challenges

Throughout this tutorial you have created the skeleton of a great game! These challenges are going
to guide you to turning it into a full fledged game and level up your skills in the process!

## Challenge 1 - Add More Levels!

This challenge should actually be pretty fun! Create some more levels so that a player has a couple
different levels that they can play :)

## Challenge 2 - Customize the Art

Design your art, invent your own theme. Angry Birds was not invented as the game you have seen. The company that made the game asked employees for ideas. One of the employees showed the image of a couple birds. People liked the picture and they invented the game. They didn't know what the game was at first they only had the picture of the birds! 

## Challenge 3 - Implement Game State

In the previous tutorial, Sushi Neko, you learned about creating state for your game to keep track
of when the player is ready, playing, or has gotten a game over. Your challenge is to implement
state for your game in a similar manner. You may need to create a limit to the number of oranges
a user has (aka lives), to complete this.

## Challenge 4 - Adding a Splash Screen and Menu

When you first load up a game, a splash screen is shown while the content is loading. In this 
challenge, your goal is to create a splash screen that showcases your game while it is loading.
The second half of this challenge is to create a menu scene that is loaded up first, before
jumping into any of the levels.

## Challenge 5 - GameCenter

This final challenge is going to be a bit tougher than the previous ones. You are going to add
GameCenter integration so that you can keep track of what levels a player has beaten. You want
to track the levels that are completed and show them differently than levels that have yet to be beaten.

## Challenge 6 - Publish to the App Store! 

Publish your app to the app store!

# Summary

If you have completed all of the challenges, congrats! You're all done :)
